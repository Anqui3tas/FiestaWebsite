Watching the creatures live in harmony with nature was Legel’s greatest joy.</p>
            <p>But jealousy took root in the gods. They desired Legel's power and pleasure, so they conspired to imprison him in darkness. As he was being sealed, Legel created Bijou, a reflection of himself, holding all his strength. Though the gods sealed Legel, they couldn’t destroy Bijou, who remained in the world.</p>
            <p>In their fear, the gods unleashed a powerful force, shattering Bijou and scattering his pieces across the continent. They believed Bijou, now broken, was powerless. But the peace didn’t last. One day, a song of blessing echoed through the elven forests, marking the discovery of one of Bijou’s pieces.</p>

            <p>The elves, seeing their homeland destroyed, decided to fight. But their unity faltered when Jenira, leader of another forest, refused to join the battle. He chose to hide, believing resistance was futile.</p>
            <p>“Jenira! How long do you think you can hide?” Elderine cried. “The gods are destroying everything! Will you stand by while the woods burn?”</p>
            <p>Despite Jenira’s fear, the elves rallied behind Elderine’s call. Their determination turned the tide of the battle. But victory was bittersweet. Endless waves of monsters drained their strength.</p>
            <p>The gods, desperate to end the conflict, tainted Elderine's brother Epith with greed. Betraying his kin, Epith fell into darkness, and Elderine, heartbroken, left her homeland.</p>

            <p>Finally, they reached the Deep South, far from the monsters’ reach. There, the elves encountered humans—a new race unlike any they had seen. These humans ate meat, cut trees, and built homes, living a life foreign to the elves, who harmonized with nature.</p>
            <p>“Why do you kill to live? You could survive without eating meat,” Elderine asked. The eldest human replied, “We are not as strong as the elves. We must work together and harvest the land to survive.”</p>
            <p>Though their lives were short, Elderine admired the humans’ resilience. She realized their way of life, though different, was no less righteous. “We thought our way was the only way. But your lives are just as true. I, Elderine, wish to live in peace with humans, in harmony with Legel’s blessings.”</p>

            <p>“Epith, you once loved life. Now you destroy it. How could you?” she cried.</p>
            <p>Epith replied, “The gods can recreate life. What does it matter if we burn it all to ash?”</p>
            <p>“You’re wrong! Bijou’s power brings life, not destruction!”</p>
            <p>Epith, consumed by darkness, refused to listen and imprisoned Elderine in a dark cell. A human knight named Roumen, glowing with hope, freed her. In the struggle, Roumen’s sword struck Elderine as she shielded Epith. He knelt in silence, overcome with regret.</p>

Epith, in a moment of redemption, led the charge against the monsters, fighting fiercely to atone for his sins. Elderine cast a spell, and the light of her blessing filled the battlefield, restoring hope to the elves and humans.</p>
            <p>The fallen elves, now freed from their greed, begged for forgiveness, which Elderine granted. She named them “Dark Elves” and embraced them as eternal allies. A tall stone tower was built in honor of the new harmony, and so that Epith could return one day.</p>

           <p>Then, one day, Bijou’s fragment glowed, shooting a pillar of light into the sky. All over the continent, the fragments of Bijou did the same. Sweet rain fell, and life returned to the land. This day, later known as the ‘Purification of Light,’ marked the continent's rebirth.</p>

            <p>They banished the gods of life, scattering them across the land.
